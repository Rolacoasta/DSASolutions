# StructySolutions

This is a collection of all the solutions to the Structy Problems given in the course with added tests for each solution! I do not own any of these problems or am a sole proprietor of any of this material. These are the property of Structy.

## Installation

Should have the latest version of python and required packages installed in the requirements.txt file.

## Usage

Simply use pytest to test the solutions! Feel free to add your own twist to each to see if the code can be broken!
